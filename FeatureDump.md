# Edomodo
## Assignments
Assignments are created by teachers and distributed to their students using the assignment post feature. Teachers can title their assignments, identify a due date, associate a description or prompt, and include attachments from the web, computer or Edmodo library.
When students log in, they see the assignment in their stream and can view the embedded file or media. They can then turn in their completed assignment directly to their teacher.
Teachers can track which students have turned in their assignments and natively grade (and comment on) student work allowing students to receive immediate feedback.
## Quizzes
Quiz features include the ability for teachers to create quizzes, edit and load previously created quizzes, provide a quiz description, set the time limit for a quiz, and preview a quiz before sending it to their students (group).
Edmodo supports five question types: multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, matching, and short answer. When the student submits the quiz, the teacher is notified. Once the questions are automatically scored, (except for short answers) the grades are populated into the teacher’s Edmodo grade book.
## Planner
The planner enables teachers to manage personal and group-based events and tasks. By creating an event or task, teachers can help students keep track of upcoming assignments, events, projects, school activities, professional obligations, and more.
Teacher Libraries and Student Backpacks
Teachers have personal libraries that allow them to maintain a repository of digital learning materials they have collected and want to reference or use with their students. Teachers can use Edmodo’s communities as a content discovery tool and—with one click—snap, new content appears in their library.
Similarly, students have personal backpacks that allow them to manage the content they’ve created, collected or shared with their Edmodo groups.
Teachers and students can organize their content into folders, sort by file type, group, and more.
## Profile Page
Teachers and students can create profile pages summarizing and tracking themselves as professionals or learners. Beyond optional information a teacher discloses in the About Me section, teacher profiles also display badges earned for achievements and progress on the Edmodo platform.
A student’s profile page displays a quote the student finds inspirational, tracks grade progress over time, and displays badges earned for behavior and achievement. Only a student’s teachers and classmates can view his or her profile page. A student’s profile page is not searchable or viewable by other users on the platform.
## Badges
Teachers and students can earn Edmodo badges, and teachers can earn teacher-created and publisher-created badges. Student badges award students’ hard work, participation, proud moments of achievement, perfect scores within apps’ lessons, and more. Teacher badges acknowledge their use of Edmodo, e.g., creating a class group with student membership, forming teacher connections, following a publisher community, participating in an edmodo training group, sharing content, and more.
##Publisher Communities
Publisher communities provide content and app partners an opportunity to engage directly with teachers who are using their materials or apps in their classrooms. You can (and should) use your communities as an R&D tool to learn what’s working and what’s not. Contribute to a virtual public library (called the publisher collection) that allows teachers to discover new content. Leveraging your community features allows you to improve your apps and grow your user base.

## User-Centric User Interface
Since social software is social, it provides users with a user interface that is strongly focused on the personal interests of its users. And because social media and social networking sites live by the actions of its users, it’s no wonder that social user interfaces are extremely user-centric. Twitter, Facebook and other social applications put the user in the middle of the application, focusing on the little details of users’ profiles, suggesting new friends, interests, events, groups etc. in the attempt to extend their social circles and intensify the engagement of the user.
Facebook’s front page is exemplary for an egocentric user interface. It provides detailed information about updates and notifications of a user and also provides a one-click-interface that makes it easy to update the current status, hide information provided by friends and it updates you about people a user may know or groups or conversations that the user may be interested in. Hence Facebook emphasizes the personal value of the application, putting the person at the center of the software. Twitter is another example for a similar approach: the front page is all about the user, his connections and conversations among his friends.
From the usability point of view, this approach is almost obvious – since an application is created for the customer, it should be all about the customer. However, most social applications are not task-specific like common online-banking-software, but more activity-specific: it’s all about engagement and being connected. And it’s also about using the service not to solve single tasks, but to use the application continuously and as often as possible. The more engaged the user is, the more traffic she delivers back to the service and the more users are getting engaged by the word of mouth advertising. That’s the key of social applications – and egocentric user interfaces leverage this strategy to effectively bind users to using these applications.
